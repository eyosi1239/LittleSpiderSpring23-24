Programming Project 4--LittleSpiderBoard class

The LittleSpiderBoard class places cards onto the board and manages the movement
of the cards for a version of the little spider solitaire game. The board has eight tableau piles,
one stock pile, and four foundation piles. The foundation piles begin with the two red aces
and two black kings. Each time cards are dealt from the stock, one card is dealt to
each tableau pile.
